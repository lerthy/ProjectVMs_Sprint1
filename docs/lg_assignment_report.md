- **Memory:** 2 GB RAM each
- **CPU:** 1 vCPU each
- **Storage:** 10 GB disk space each
- **Network:** Dual adapters (NAT + Internal Network)

### 1.2 Network Architecture
- **lg-vm1:** 192.168.56.101/24 (Primary server)
- **lg-vm2:** 192.168.56.102/24 (Backup server)
- **Network Type:** Internal Network for VM-to-VM communication
- **Internet Access:** NAT adapter for external connectivity

## 2. Network Configuration

### 2.1 Static IP Assignment
Successfully configured static IP addresses using Ubuntu's netplan configuration system.

**Configuration Process:**
1. Edited `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` on both VMs
2. Applied network configuration with `sudo netplan apply`
3. Verified connectivity between VMs

**Network Configuration File (lg-vm1):**
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp0s8:
      dhcp4: true
    enp0s9:
      addresses:
        - 192.168.56.101/24
      dhcp4: false
```



### 2.2 Connectivity Testing
Verified network connectivity between both VMs and internet access.

---

## 3. User Management and Security

### 3.1 User Account Creation
Created required user accounts on both virtual machines:

- **syncladmin:** System administrator with sudo privileges
- **datasender:** User responsible for sending files (lg-vm1)
- **datareceiver:** User responsible for receiving files (lg-vm2)

**Commands Used:**
```bash
sudo adduser syncadmin
sudo adduser  datasender
sudo adduser datareceiver
sudo usermod -aG sudo syncadmin
```



### 3.2 Group Management
Created and configured security groups:
- **syncgroup:** Contains datasender and datareceiver users
- **projectgroup:** Created by automation script for additional users

---

## 4. Shared Directory and Permissions

### 4.1 Directory Structure
Created secure shared directory on lg-vm1:
- **Location:** `/data/shared`
- **Owner:** datasender
- **Group:** syncgroup
- **Permissions:** 770 (owner and group full access, others no access)



### 4.2 File Creation and Ownership
Successfully created test files with proper ownership and permissions.
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /data/shared

# Set ownership and permissions
sudo chown datasender:syncgroup /data/shared
sudo chmod 770 /data/shared

```

## 5. SSH Configuration and Key Authentication

### 5.1 SSH Service Installation
Installed and configured OpenSSH server on both VMs:
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server rsync 
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```



### 5.2 SSH Key Authentication Setup
Implemented passwordless SSH authentication between VMs:

1. Generated RSA key pair on lg-vm1 (datasender user)
2. Copied public key to lg-vm2 (datareceiver user)
3. Tested passwordless authentication

**Process:**
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id datasender@192.168.56.102  # Assuming you're syncing as datasender
```



---

## 6. File Transfer Implementation

### 6.1 Rsync Configuration
Implemented secure file synchronization using rsync over SSH:

**Command Used:**
```bash
rsync -avz /data/shared/ datareceiver@192.168.56.102:/home/datareceiver/received_data/
```



### 6.2 Transfer Verification
Verified successful file transfer by listing contents on destination server:
---

## 7. Firewall Security Configuration

### 7.1 UFW Firewall Setup
Configured Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) on both VMs:

**Security Rules Implemented:**
- Allow SSH (port 22) for remote administration
- Allow rsync (port 873) for file synchronization
- Deny all other incoming connections by default

**Commands Used:**
```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow 873
```



---

## 8. System Service Management

### 8.1 Custom Systemd Service Creation
Developed custom systemd service to log system time every minute:

**Service File (`/etc/systemd/system/timelog.service`):**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Log Time to File

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/date >> /var/log/time.log

```

**Timer File (`/etc/systemd/system/timelog.timer`):**
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run log-time.service every minute

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* *:*:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target

```



### 8.2 Service Verification
Verified service functionality by monitoring log output:



---

## 9. Network Traffic Analysis

### 9.1 Wireshark Configuration Attempt
Attempted network traffic capture using Wireshark on host machine:

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Internal Network configuration prevents host-based packet capture
- VirtualBox Internal Network traffic is isolated from host interfaces

**Resolution:**
- Documented network communication through successful rsync transfers
- Alternative monitoring implemented through system logs and SSH connection verification



**Technical Note:** Due to the Internal Network configuration providing VM-to-VM isolation, direct packet capture from the host machine was not feasible. However, network functionality was thoroughly verified through successful file transfers and connectivity tests.

---

## 10. Automation Script Development

### 10.1 Bash Script Creation
Developed comprehensive setup script (`lg_setup.sh`) to automate user and directory creation:

**Script Features:**
- Creates three additional users: lg-user1, lg-user2, adminuser
- Adds adminuser to sudo group
- Creates `/data/project` directory with secure permissions
- Implements projectgroup for access control
- Provides verification and error handling



### 10.2 Script Execution and Verification
Successfully executed automation script:



---

## 11. System Testing and Validation

Performed end-to-end testing of all implemented components:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Network connectivity between VMs
- ✅ SSH passwordless authentication
- ✅ File synchronization with rsync
- ✅ Firewall rules active and functional
- ✅ System service running and logging
- ✅ Automation script executing successfully



### 11.2 Performance Metrics
- **File Transfer Speed:** Efficient local network transfer

## 12. Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution

### 12.1 Issues Encountered and Solutions

**Issue 1: VirtualBox Host-Only Adapter Conflicts**
- **Problem:** Host-Only network adapter causing VM boot failures
- **Solution:** Switched to Internal Network configuration
- **Result:** Stable VM operation with proper isolation

**Issue 2: Directory Permission Conflicts**
- **Problem:** Permission denied errors when creating files in shared directory
- **Solution:** Adjusted directory permissions and ownership
- **Result:** Proper file creation and access control

**Issue 3: SSH Authentication Failures**
- **Problem:** Initial SSH key authentication not working
- **Solution:** Regenerated SSH keys and reconfigured authentication
- **Result:** Seamless passwordless SSH connections

### 12.2 Lessons Learned
- Virtual network configuration requires careful consideration of isolation vs. monitoring needs
- Proper permission management is critical for multi-user file sharing
- SSH key authentication provides better security than password-based access
